# 🛒 Seabay Shopping Cart 🛒
This is a mobile-ready shopping cart service for Seabay, an eBay clone. 

# Motivation
This service is part of a front-end capstone project that I was a part of at Hack Reactor. There is an accompanying proxy service that I created [here](https://github.com/seabay-hratx42-fec/proxy-ross).
